You are given a list, L, and another list, P, containing integers sorted in ascending order. The operation printLots(L, P) will print the elements in L that are in positions specified by P. For instance, if P == 1, 3, 4, 5, the elements in positions 1, 3, 4 and 6 in L are printed. Write the procedure printLots(L, P). You may user only the public STL container operations.
